    Dining in China: The Ultimate Guide for International Students 🍜

Living in China as an international student is an exciting chance to immerse yourself in one of the world’s most diverse and flavorful food cultures!

But while it’s an adventure for your taste buds, it can also be a little challenging, especially with **language barriers** and **cultural differences** in dining. Whether you’re enjoying a meal at a restaurant or ordering food through an app, understanding some basic tips can really make the experience more enjoyable. 

Here’s your ultimate guide to **navigating China’s dining scene** like a pro! 😋

## **Ordering Food Offline: Language and Culture Insights 🍽️**

### **Menu Translations May Be Misleading 🧐**

While many Chinese restaurants offer English menus, the translations don’t always capture the full essence of the dish. For example, "水煮鱼" (literally "boiled fish") doesn’t convey its bold, spicy, and numbing flavor (麻辣) that makes it a beloved dish. 🌶️

!!! tip
    If you’re unsure about a dish, don’t hesitate to ask the staff for more details or recommendations. They’ll often be happy to explain the dish, and you might discover some hidden gems you wouldn’t have noticed otherwise.

### **Must-Know Chinese Phrases for Dining 🗣️**

Here are some helpful phrases to use when ordering in person:

<center>

| Situation     | Short Chinese Expressions              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Allergies     | "不要花生，过敏" (No peanuts, allergy) |
| Spice Level   | "微辣/不要辣" (Mild spicy/No spice)    |
| Vegetarian    | "不要肉" (No meat)                     |
| Food Temp     | "冰的/热的" (Iced/Hot)                 |
| Sauce Request | "酱分开" (Sauce separate)              |

</center>

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Don’t forget to add "谢谢" **(xièxie)** at the end to sound polite! 😊

---

### **Cultural Differences in Dining 🍲**

As mentioned in [Chinese Culinary Culture](Chinese Culinary Culture.md), Chinese dining culture typically revolves around **sharing meals**, which might feel different from the Western habit of ordering individual dishes. Instead of each person getting their own plate, you’ll often find several dishes placed on the table for everyone to enjoy together.  

![](7/一桌菜.jpg)

!!! tip
    Embrace the shared dining experience! It’s a fun way to taste a variety of flavors. If you’re not comfortable with super spicy dishes, simply **let the staff know**, and they can adjust the spice level to suit your preferences.

### **Cultural Alerts ⚠️**

<div class="grid cards force-vertical" markdown>

-   **🍽️ Portion Size**
    
    ---
    
    "Small" portions often mean 2-3 servings, so it's safe to start with 2 dishes per person.

-   **💸 Hidden Charges**

    ---
    
    Always ask, "免费吗?" (Is it free?) to check if there are charges for things like tea or napkins.

-   **⏳ Time Tricks**

    ---
    
    "马上" (soon) usually means 10-15 minutes. If you need it quicker, ask "15分钟能好吗?" (Ready in 15 minutes?)


---

## **Food Delivery Apps: Navigating the Digital World 📱**

### **English Translations Aren’t Always Accurate 🤔**

Food delivery apps like Meituan and Ele.me are incredibly convenient, but their English translations can sometimes be confusing. For example, "宫保鸡丁" (Kung Pao Chicken) is well-known, but the translation doesn’t capture the special cooking techniques or cultural significance of the dish. 🐔

![](7/鸡.jpg)

!!! tip
    When in doubt, do a quick online search to better understand the dish’s ingredients and flavors. You can also ask friends or fellow students who have tried the dish for advice.

---

### **Search Like a Local 🔍**

When searching for food on delivery apps, use the formula: **[Cuisine Theme]** + **[Cooking Techniques]** (e.g., "四川 麻辣烫" for Sichuan spicy soup). This helps you find exactly what you’re craving, and it’s a trick locals use to filter through the thousands of options. 📲

!!! tip "(づ> v <)づ🌈⛅️✨"
    For detailed information about the formula, check our previous pages of [Chinese Cooking Techniques](Chinese Cooking Techniques.md) & [Chinese Cuisine in ZJU](Chinese Cuisine in ZJU.md)


For special requests, you can add "备注" (notes), such as:  

- "放门口" (Leave at door)  
- "不要打电话" (No phone call)

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Screenshot your order details if there are any issues with your order, as it can make dealing with customer service much easier.

---

### **Lack of Cultural Context 🏮**

Food delivery apps rarely explain the cultural significance of dishes. For example, "麻辣火锅" (spicy hotpot) is a staple, but its rich cultural history might not be clear without a bit of background knowledge. 🫕

!!! tip
    A quick search online can provide useful information about the dish, and don’t be afraid to ask others for their insights. This can enhance your appreciation of the dish and make the experience more enjoyable.
