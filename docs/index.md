# What is SQTP?

The SQTP (Student Quality Training Project) is a "Dream Boosting Initiative" focused on student development, designed to help students achieve their aspirations for enhancing individual or group capabilities and qualities. Guided by the fundamental principle of cultivating virtue through education, the program emphasizes student-led application, evaluation, and implementation, with professional instructors providing mentorship. Through team formation, project proposal, management execution, and final evaluation, students actively engage in critical thinking, exploratory learning, and motivation cultivation, thereby comprehensively improving their overall competencies.

Themes for SQTP applications include categories such as **student development**, **collective building**, and **campus life**.

As a comprehensive specialized training program for quality and capability development, the SQTP’s content design should incorporate three core modules:

1. **Theoretical Knowledge Module** – Strengthening foundational theories related to capability and quality enhancement.
2. **Simulation Training Module** – Fostering self-guided experiential learning through practical simulations.
3. **Practical Application Module** – Internalizing theoretical knowledge via real-world implementation and reflection.
