# What is SQTP?

​	The SQTP (Student Quality Training Project) is a "Dream Boosting Initiative" focused on student development, designed to help students achieve their aspirations for enhancing individual or group capabilities and qualities. Guided by the fundamental principle of cultivating virtue through education, the program emphasizes student-led application, evaluation, and implementation, with professional instructors providing mentorship. Through team formation, project proposal, management execution, and final evaluation, students actively engage in critical thinking, exploratory learning, and motivation cultivation, thereby comprehensively improving their overall competencies.

​	Themes for SQTP applications include categories such as **student development**, **collective building**, and **campus life**.

​	As a comprehensive specialized training program for quality and capability development, the SQTP’s content design should incorporate three core modules:

# Our SQTP

​	    Themed "Taste Bud Frontiers Decoded: Overcoming International Students' Food Adaptation Challenges", our SQTP perceived the phenomenon that some international ZJUers experience varying degrees of culinary acculturation stress when encountering authentic Chinese cuisine. What's more, from linguistic perspective we note another intriguing phenomena worthy of attention : Some international students lack familiarity with Chinese culinary vocabulary, hindering their ability to articulate dietary preferences and exacerbating challenges in adapting to campus Chinese dining.

​	    Building on these observations, our team actively engages in the SQTP initiative to facilitate international students’ adaptation to campus Chinese cuisine. We do hope that through our efforts:
