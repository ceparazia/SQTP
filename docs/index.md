???+ question "What's This Site (๑•᎑•๑)"
    This is a site summarizing our **SQTP** Results (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)

    As a group of **freshmen in ZJU**, we are taking an active part making a   difference: helping ==**make Chinese food more enjoyable**== for ya~


???+ question "What Is SQTP ( ╹ -╹)?"
    ​The SQTP (Student Quality Training Project) is a "Dream Boosting Initiative" focused on student development, designed to help students achieve their aspirations for enhancing individual or group capabilities and qualities. Guided by the fundamental principle of cultivating virtue through education, the program emphasizes **student-led:**

    thereby comprehensively improving their overall competencies.

Themes for SQTP applications include categories such as **student development**, **collective building**, and **campus life**.

As a comprehensive specialized training program for quality and capability development, the SQTP’s content design should incorporate three core modules:

# Our SQTP🌟
Welcome to our **SQTP Dream Boosting Initiative**! As ZJU freshmen, we're passionate about making Chinese cuisine more accessible and enjoyable for international students. Through **culinary exploration** and **linguistic research**, we're bridging taste bud gaps one bite at a time! (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)

???+ tip "(づ> v <)づ🌈⛅️✨"
    <center>Food is the universal language, but sometimes we need a translator for our taste buds!✨</center>

​Themed ==**"Taste Bud Frontiers Decoded: Overcoming International Students' Food Adaptation Challenges"**==, our SQTP perceived the phenomenon that some international ZJUers experience varying degrees of ==**culinary acculturation stress**== when encountering authentic Chinese cuisine. What's more, from linguistic perspective we note another intriguing phenomena worthy of attention : Some international students lack familiarity with ==**Chinese culinary vocabulary**==, hindering their ability to articulate dietary preferences and exacerbating challenges in adapting to campus Chinese dining.
