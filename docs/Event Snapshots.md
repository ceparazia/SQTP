# Jiangnan Flavour

<img src="images/1.jpg" alt="图片描述"  />



## Inspiration

We discovered these problems faced by international students when adapting to Chinese food:

- Unfamiliar with Chinese texture vocabulary
- Unfamiliar with Chinese culinary cooking techniques

Therefore, on Dec 20th, 2025, we take an active part in the New Year Gala organized by ISU.

## Goals

Through this event we hope to progress in:

- Collecting first-hand linguistic information of the Chinese taste expressions adopted by international students
- Promoting international student-friendly Chinese dish like the Creamy Yam
- Introducing Chinese food culture via the historical heritage of Nan Song Hu Ji



## Our Unique Cuisine

- Creamy Yam in 3 different flavors:

  - Sugary osmanthus flower sauce (Made by ourselves⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡!!!)
  - Blueberry sauce
  - Rose petal sauce (Quite amazing huh?( • ᴗ - ) ✧)

- Hu's confectionery of the Southern Song Dynasty (or Nan Song Hu Ji)

### WHY These Cuisines?

#### 1.Chinese Essence, Western Application

• **Quintessential Chinese Ingredients**

- Chinese yam: A staple in Traditional Chinese Medicine cuisine
- Osmanthus sugar: A Hangzhou heritage ingredient dating to Southern Song Dynasty
- Rose petal jam: Yunnan's floral terroir expression

• **Western Accents**

- Condensed milk & cream: Spellbinding culinary integration
- Cake piping technique (originally decided): Typical western decoration techniques
- Mint garnish: Modern gastronomic plating aesthetics



#### 2.**Steaming as Cultural Signature**

> [!NOTE]
>
> Actually we used boiling as a substitution of steaming. For the reason, come to **Kitchenantics**.
>
> ==这里需要一个网页链接==

Unlike Western cooking's predominant roasting/baking:

- 72% of traditional Chinese dishes employ steaming (per 2023 CIAA data)
- Philosophical alignment with "和" (harmony) - minimal nutrient disruption



## Our Games

- Taste our cuisine and **describe the flavor in Chinese**

  ![](images/10.jpg)

- Try peeling the yam (Sounds easy but quite slippery on hand! )

## Our Recipe(,,>ヮ<,,)

### Creamy Yam

#### Ingredients

- 1 kg mealy yam (preferably iron-stick yam)

- 1 tbsp white vinegar (for soaking)

- **Coating**: Generous amount of white sugar

- 60g condensed milk

- 65g light cream

  > [!CAUTION]
  >
  > Note that excessive light cream will make the yam too thin to shape 



#### Steps

1. **Prep the Yam**

   - Wear gloves

     > [!WARNING]
     >
     > Sticky slime on peeled yams will cause an allergic reaction.
     >
     > It really iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitches!!!

   - Peel and soak in vinegar water (1 tbsp white vinegar + water) for 10 mins to **prevent oxidation** (browning).

     ![](images/23.jpg)

2. **Clean & Cut**

   - Scrub yam segments in vinegar water until **smooth and white** (removes allergens).
   - Cut into chunks, place on a heatproof plate, and **liberally coat with sugar**.

3. **Steam**

   - Steam for 30 mins over high heat. Sugar will melt into syrup.

4. **Blend** (*Critical texture steps*)

   - Transfer yam + syrup to a blender. Add condensed milk and cream.
   - **Blend for 10-20 secs max** (*over-blending makes paste too thin*).
   - **No water added** – relies on natural moisture offered by the syrup.

   **Alternative Methods:**

   - *Hand-mashing*: For grainier texture (traditional approach).
   - *No dairy*: Lighter, herbal flavor but less aromatic.

5. **Pipe & Serve**

   - Sieve paste if lumpy (*prevents clogging piping tip*).

   - Shape the paste onto plates.

     > We initially planned to make delicate decorations with a piping bag, but it's a pity that such a step isn't implemented due to time constraints (◞‸ ◟)💧

   - Garnish with mint leaves

   - Top with the **sauce** and enjoyദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧.







### Osmanthus Sugar

> [!NOTE]
>
> Consisting of water, sugar and osmanthus flowers, Osmanthus Sugar clearly distinguishes from Osmanthus Honey Blends

#### Ingredients & Tools

- 300g white granulated sugar
- 150g water *(measured precisely)*
- 20g dried osmanthus flowers *(tea-grade preferred)*
- 30g lemon juice *(≈½ lemon, strained)*
- 1g salt *(**anti-crystallization** agent)*
- Heavy-bottomed saucepan *(essential for even heating)*



#### Steps

1. **Flower Prep**

   - Rinse (if using fresh) → Sun-dry until crisp
   - *or* Use pre-dried tea-grade osmanthus *(no washing needed)*

2. **Sugar Syrup Base**

   - Combine sugar + water → **High heat** until boiling
   - Reduce to **low simmer** (6 mins)
   - 🔥 *Critical: Water ratio must be exact!*
     - *"Better under- than over-hydrated – easily adjusted later"*

3. **Floral Infusion**

   - Add osmanthus + lemon juice + salt → **Return to boil**

     ![](images/20.jpg)

     > [!NOTE]
     >
     > Actually from the photo you can find that our cook failed to ==这里还没写完==

   - Simmer 4 mins *(set timer!)*

   - 🍋 *Pro Tip: Strain lemon seeds to avoid bitterness*



#### Our Culinary Creation



## Kitchenantics

- On our trial (weeks before the event) we used a steamer, which created ideal Creamy Yam smoothly. BUT, on the real run we find the kitchen **WITHOUT A SUITABLE STEAMER**!!!( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)⁭ ⁭

- We tried using microwave oven, but it's a little challenging for us to control the heat, as evidenced by the culinary disaster below...

  ![](images/56.jpg)

  The white sugar caramelized upon heating – expanding with vigorous bubbling as pyrolysis occurred, releasing aromatic compounds and developing a rich amber hue through the Maillard reaction.

  ~~Wow, mouthwatering caramel!~~

  The yam and sugar are tightly bonded together, forming a hard...hmm...statue? We tried placing the plate upside down, and the dish remain still and didn't fall...

  Luckily, we managed to find substitutional methods for steaming like boiling, and thus successfully finished the thrilling cooking.

  The hilarious part? We take the kitchen catastrophe on the event, and multiple people actually eyed that culinary trainwreck with interest and asked for a taste(˶°ㅁ°)!!

  Speaking of which, presently the statue is still kept as a memorial by one of our group member. It remains intact so far as months have passed...
