# **Jiangnan Flavour** 🌟

![](images/1.jpg)



## Inspiration 🪄

As highlighted on our [Home Page](index.md), our research uncovered several major hurdles international students face when navigating Chinese cuisine:

<div class="grid cards" markdown style="grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);">

- :tongue:Unfamiliar with **Chinese food texture vocabulary**

- :cooking:Unfamiliar with **Chinese culinary cooking techniques**

- :cold_sweat:Facing difficulty in articulating **meal order in Chinese**

</div>

On December 20, 2025, we brought our solution to life at **ISU**'s flagship multicultural event- **==New Year Gala==**! ✨

        Osmanthus flowers usually bloom in clusters, with numerous small flowers closely gathered together. This clustered growth pattern is seen as a metaphor for family members gathering and living in harmony. Also, they are usually harvested during Mid-Autumn Festival when osmanthus blooms coincide with the fullest moon.

    -   🍀 **Prosperity & Abundance**

        ---

        Osmanthus blossoms are often golden - yellow, an auspicious color that is traditionally associated with wealth and luxury in Chinese culture. Osmanthus is often mentioned in ancient poetry and literature, and is closely related to celebrations and joyous occasions.

!!! tip "🌟Rose Petal Sauce: A Fragrant Taste of Yunnan's Heritage"

    Indulge in the sweet, floral magic of authentic Chinese rose petal sauce—a luxurious spread where fragrance, flavor, and tradition bloom together!

    The culinary use of roses in China dates back to the **Tang Dynasty**. In Yunnan(1), edible roses (such as Rosa rugosa) have long been used to make floral jams, teas, and herbal remedies.
    { .annotate }

    1. Yunnnan: A province in southwest China, celebrated as the "Kingdom of Flowers". Boasts a remarkable floral diversity due to its ideal climate and rich biodiversity. Kunming's Dounan Flower Market, the largest in Asia, cements Yunnan’s status as a floral powerhouse.

    Unlike Western rose jams (often made with fragrant but inedible roses), Chinese rose jam emphasizes naturally sweet, edible varieties with minimal added sugar, preserving the flower's delicate essence.

    Try this valuable culinary heritage and feel its charm! (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶)

    🥄Each bite you take is a crumbly, sweet portal to 800 years ago, when Hangzhou (then called Lin'an) served as China's dazzling capital under the Southern Song Dynasty.💫

</div>

!!! tip "✨Nan Song Hu Ji"
    Each pastry from Hu's confectionery is a work of art. Drawing inspiration from the opulent aesthetics of the Southern Song Dynasty, these treats often feature intricate shapes and patterns, reminiscent of the elaborate designs found on ancient porcelain and silk. Skilled artisans use traditional molds and hand - crafting techniques, carefully shaping each piece to resemble flowers, animals, or iconic symbols from that era. For instance, you might find pastries molded into the shape of lotus blossoms, which held great significance in Chinese culture as a symbol of purity and beauty.

    ---

    
    
    **• Southern Song Dynasty Revival**
    
    - *Nan Song Hu Ji* pastries resurrect 12th-century recipes, like edible time capsules from Hangzhou’s golden age. These exquisite pastries mirror the poetic scenery that inspired Song dynasty painters.
    
    **• Osmanthus’ Cultural Code**
    The osmanthus in our desserts isn’t just flavor – it’s a **living symbol**. In China:
    
    - Blooms during the Mid-Autumn Festival (**family reunion** season)
    - The signature **autumnal aroma** - osmanthus' sweet-spicy scent that has inspired Chinese poets for a millennium
    - Used in **wedding desserts** as a prosperity charm
    
    **• Medicinal Wisdom Meets Modern Palates**
    Chinese yam (*shānyào*):
    
    - Called "the people’s ginseng" in Traditional Chinese Medicine for digestive benefits
    - Its sticky texture represents **longevity** in food symbolism
    - Possessing great cross-cultural appeal along with sugary osmanthus, blueberry & rose petal sauces
    
    


-   :man_cook:{ .lg .middle } __East-West Culinary Alchemy__

    • **Traditional Chinese Culinary Techniques**

    Unlike Western cooking's predominant roasting, lots of traditional Chinese dishes employ steaming to preserve *qi* (vital energy) – a Confucian "harmony" principle
    
    ???+ note
    
        Actually we used boiling as a substitution of steaming. For the reason, come to [**→Night Before the Event**](#night-before-the-event).(ó﹏ò｡)
    
    • **Integrated Western Culinary Techniques**
    
    - **Condensed Milk Application**
        - Balancing yam’s plain notes with sugary sweetness
        - Creating smoother texture than traditional Chinese granulated sugar coatings
    - **Light Cream Emulsification**
        - Stabilizes yam’s mucilage (prevents stringiness)
        - Enables piping consistency without gelatin (uncommon in classic Chinese desserts)
    
    - **Cake Piping Methods**
        - Integrating Chinese flavors with French pastry techniques
    - **Mint Garnish Logic**
      *Modern gastronomy color theory*:
        - Green contrasts white-yam for visual "pop"
        - Freshens palate between bites (Western tasting menu approach)
    
    - **Temperature Control**
      Precision simmering:
        - More accurate than traditional "wu huo" (武火) flame adjustment
        - Preserves osmanthus’ volatile aromatics

!!! tip "The Great Yam Peeling Challenge: A Happy Accident!⚡"
    As mentioned earlier, this game was **originally unplanned**! When our stall became too popular 🏆, our afternoon shift had to get creative—introducing the "Slippery Yam Peeling Showdown" to control the crowd craving our signature yam purée!⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡

    <div class="grid cards" markdown>

        Fast and clean peeling? Nearly a superpower unless experienced!
    </div>

    Soon our peeling station turned into a slippery adventure that drew constant crowds. What started as portion control became another crowd magnet, boosting energy in our stall!♪(๑ᴖ◡ᴖ๑)♪

    It's also a team bonding moment as our team members also engaged in this funpacked activity. Anyway, after peeling dozens of yams the night before, we’re basically pro peelers!(๑˘ᴗ˘๑)✨

### Creamy Yam Purée 🧁
<div class="grid cards force-vertical" markdown>

-   🧁Creamy Yam Purée ==**MADE BY OURSELVES!✨**==
    

    ---

    ![](images/9.jpg){ .float-left }

    ???+ note
        Merged with sugar and milk, the aromatic yam offers you an unparalled silky flavor mingled with sweetness.
    
      

</div>

#### Ingredients
???+ note
    Note that this recipe is based on the usage amount of 1kg yam. During the actual event, we used a total of **4.6kg** of Chinese yam. All other ingredients were proportionally increased to maintain recipe accuracy.
- 1 kg mealy yam (preferably iron-stick yam)
- 1 tbsp white vinegar (for soaking)
- **Coating**: Generous amount of white granulated sugar
- 🥛60g condensed milk
- 🍨65g light cream

???+ caution
    💦Note that excessive light cream will make the yam too thin to shape (ó﹏ò｡) 

#### Steps

1. **Prep the Yam**

    * Wear gloves

    ???+ warning
        🧤Sticky slime on peeled yams will cause an allergic reaction.
        
        **IT REALLY IIIIIIIIIIIIIIItches!!!😫**

    * Peel and soak in vinegar water (1 tbsp white vinegar + water) for 10 mins to **prevent oxidation** (browning).

     ![](images/23.jpg)

2. **Clean & Cut**

    - 🧽Scrub yam segments in vinegar water until **smooth and white**✨ (removes allergens).
    - 🔪Cut into chunks, place on a plate, and **liberally coat with sugar**.

3. **Steam**

    - ♨️Steam for 30 mins over high heat. Sugar will melt into syrup🍯.

4. **🌀Blend** (*Critical texture steps*)

    - Transfer yam + syrup to a blender. Add condensed milk and cream.
    - **Blend for 10-20 secs max** (*over-blending makes paste too thin*).
    - 🌟 **No water added** – relies on natural moisture offered by the syrup.

    ???+ tip "Alternatives💡"
        - ✋Hand-mashing: For grainier texture.
        - 🌿No dairy: Lighter, herbal flavor but less aromatic.

5. **Pipe & Serve**

    - Sieve paste if lumpy (*prevents clogging piping tip*).

    - Shape the paste onto plates or other containers.

    - 🌿Garnish with mint leaves
    
    - Top with the **sauce** and enjoyദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧.

### Osmanthus Sugar 🍯
<div class="grid cards force-vertical" markdown>

-   ✨Osmanthus Sugar ==**MADE BY OURSELVES!🌟**==
    

    ---

    ???+ note
        Consisting of water, sugar and osmanthus flowers, Osmanthus Sugar clearly distinguishes from Osmanthus Honey Blends
    
      

</div>


#### Ingredients & Tools

- 300g white granulated sugar
- 150g water *(⚖️measured precisely)*
- 🌼20g dried osmanthus flowers *(tea-grade preferred)*
- 🍋30g lemon juice *(≈½ lemon, strained)*
- 1g salt *(**anti-crystallization** agent)*
- Heavy-bottomed saucepan *(essential for even heating)*



#### Steps

1. **🌼Flower Prep**

    - Rinse (if using fresh) → Sun-dry until crisp
    - *or* Use pre-dried tea-grade osmanthus *(no washing needed)*

2. **Sugar Syrup Base**

    - Combine sugar + water → 🔥**High heat** until boiling
    - Reduce to **low simmer** (6 mins)
    - ⚖️ **Critical**: Water ratio must be exact!
    ???+ tip
        Insights perfected through our chef's dedicated home kitchen experiments (refer to [→ Trial Runs](#osmanthus-sugar-adventure))：

        💦Better under- than 🌊over-hydrated – easily adjusted later
        

3. 🌸 **Floral Infusion**

    - Add osmanthus + lemon juice + salt → **Return to boil**

        ???+ question "Why add **salt** 🧂 & **lemon juice** 🍋? ( ˶°ㅁ°) !!"
            <div class="grid cards" markdown style="grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">

            -   🧊 **Anti-Crystallization**
    
                ---

                Disrupts sugar molecular bonds to prevent gritty texture. Prevents sucrose inversion during simmering


            -   ✨ **Flavor Enhancer**

                ---

                Preserves osmanthus' volatile aromatics & Amplifies floral sweetness


            </div>

            During the final preparation, amidst the time constraints and unexpected kitchenware incompatibility ( See[ → Night Before the Event](#night-before-the-event)), our team prioritized adding the lemon juice but unfortunately overlooked incorporating the salt in one batch. (,,>﹏<,,)

            For those recreating this fragrant syrup at home, do include that pinch of salt – it makes all the difference in enhancing the floral sweetness & ensuring silky texture! (˶˃⤙˂˶)


     ![](images/20.jpg)

    ???+ tip "Mishap ( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)"
        Actually from the photo you can find that due to the problem mentioned before (time constraints and unexpected kitchenware incompatibility) , our chef inadvertently reversed the sequence, adding osmanthus flowers immediately after sugar - yet serendipitously, the dish retained its aromatic integrity.🍀( ⸝⸝´꒳`⸝⸝)

    - Simmer 4 mins *(set timer!)*

    - 🍋 Pro Tip: Strain lemon seeds to avoid bitterness

### Ingredient Quest 🕵

To achieve the **ultimate velvety texture**, we sourced **iron-stick yams** (*Dioscorea opposita*) – the MVP of Traditional Chinese Medicine cuisine!

To ensure sufficient ingredients before the event, our chef scanned **at least 3 campus-area markets** for price/quality comparisons 📊

Finally we sourced premium fresh iron-stick yams via **Dingdong Maicai** app🛵 mainly.

### Trial Runs 🍳

#### Creamy Yam Purée Prototype 🧁

The novelty of Creamy Yam Purée greatly intrigued us! Our chef implemented ==**preliminary trials at home**== using a steamer, achieving excellent results(๑´ڡ`๑).

In his "kitchen lab" our chef:

- ♨️Perfected steaming with a **Steaming drawer**
- ⚖️Discovered **adequate rate** to reconcile yam,granulated sugar, condensed milk & light cream



#### Osmanthus Sugar Adventure 🍯
Our chef then attempted making osmanthus sugar in a wok. During this trial, he miscalculated the sugar-to-water ratio, accidentally **adding too much water** initially and compensating with extra sugar later(｡>﹏<). This valuable mistake taught us to **strictly control water measurements** during the actual preparation.

Our chef experienced what can only be described as a revelatory sensory moment - the velvety smooth texture contrasted dramatically with the coarse, fibrous quality of traditional soup yams. This textural alchemy alone demonstrates the innovative spirit of New Chinese Cuisine! (≧ᗜ≦)

!!! tip "More Than Just a Culinary Win"
    This successful experiment did more than please our palates - it:

    ✅ Validated our East-West fusion approach

    ✅ Boosted team morale before the big event

    ✅ Sparked immediate excitement to share this creation

### Kitchen Recon 📝

After reserving the **campus Bizhiju kitchen**, our chef inspected its facilities one week prior. Drawing from his home trials, he confirmed that the kitchen had essential equipment📋✅:

- refrigerator
- microwave
- oven
- induction cooker
- rice cooker


With all the equipment needed, our team's confidence skyrocketed!✧｡٩(ˊᗜˋ )و✧*｡

Regrettably, our chef hadn't thoroughly verified the **kitchenware compatibility.** And that had surely caused us a challenge!(,,>ࡇ<,,) Refer to[ →The Night Before the Event](#night-before-the-event)

| Equipment         | Status                                          |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Fridge | ✔️ Perfect for **Culinary Creation** **Storage** |
| Rice cooker       | ❓ Available for steaming?               |
| Microwave        | ❓ Alternative for steaming?            |

</center>

### Equipment Prep 📦

We carefully considered the event logistics! Anticipating **individual servings** of yam purée, we bought **pastry boxes** in advance. The dainty yam purée paired perfectly with these charming checkered boxes! Combined with our use of mint leaves, we successfully created dishes that delighted not only your tongue but also your eyeballs! ( ⸝⸝´꒳`⸝⸝)

What's more, we've also taken into consideration the gloves and peelers needed for the event. Every detail(except the steamer(,,>﹏<,,)) was meticulously planned and prepared for this event—we left nothing to chance!ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧

### Additional Creativity 🌶️

We had another unrealized idea - ==**introducing Chinese spices!**== Chinese cuisine employs spices with profound depth. The renowned "Five-Spice" flavor profile in Chinese culinary art specifically combines:

1. **Star anise** – Sweet licorice vibe ✨
2. **Sichuan pepper** – Tingly "mala" buzz 🌶️
3. **Cassia bark** – Warm cinnamon hug 🪵
4. **Cloves** – Powerful floral punch 🌺
5. **Fennel seeds** – Gentle herbal whisper 🍃

We originally planned an **interactive game** - identifying these spices and describing their flavors! Though unfulfilled, we highly recommend exploring the richness of Chinese spices! (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶) .ᐟ.ᐟ

### Night Before the Event 🌙

After weeks of meticulous preparation, our team finally reached the thrilling eve of the event! Armed with recipes and radiating excitement, we dove headfirst into preparing our signature dishes at **Bizhiju kitchen** with unstoppable enthusiasm!" ✨🍳

All those dedicated planning sessions led to this moment! As we peeled, chopped, and laughed together, the kitchen buzzed with the electric energy of a team ready to shine.⚡🤝

Despite our thorough preparation (including bringing a home steamer and purchasing a metal trivet), we faced a critical setback concerning kitchenware compatibility:

<div class="grid cards" markdown style="grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">

  - 🚫 Oversized home steamer for the kitchen's rice cooker
  - 📏 The trivet was too tall for the induction cooker, preventing lid closure
</div>


This threatened to derail our signature dish's most crucial step: achieving the perfect steamed yam texture. (,,>ࡇ<,,)

Undeterred, our team refused to surrender and proactively sought solutions:

Through perseverance, we overcame these obstacles and achieved the desired fluffy yam texture against all odds.✨ 

And along this adventure we also gained unexpected fun! ε(´｡•᎑•`)っ 💕( Details in [:material-arrow-right:Kitchenantics](#kitchenantics)).

As we concluded the night's intense cooking session and cleaned the kitchen, an extraordinary sense of accomplishment mingled with joy settled over the team.(♡ˊ͈ ꒳ ˋ͈) The photo below captures our exhausted but triumphant crew—food warriors who turned potential disaster into delicious victory!

### Why This Battle Mattered 💝

This experience crystallized two profound truths:

<div class="grid cards" markdown style="grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">

  - **🤝Team Alchemy**
  
    ---
  
    Through peeling wars and steamer crises, we discovered that true cohesion forms in the crucible of shared challenges—our makeshift steamer became a metaphor for adaptive teamwork.

  - **🌍Cultural Alchemy**

    As our "culinary statue" (more on that in [→kitchenantics](#kitchenantics)) would later prove:
</div>

<center>🌟"Food—even failed experiments—sparks cross-cultural curiosity faster than phrasebooks ever could." </center>





### Kitchenantics 🥳

As mentioned in [→Trial Runs](#trial-runs), on our trial (weeks before the event) we used a steamer, which yielded ideal Creamy Yam Purée smoothly. 



BUT, on the real run we find the kitchen **WITHOUT A SUITABLE STEAMER**!!!( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)⁭ (refer to ⁭[→Night Before the Event](#night-before-the-event))


Our subsequent experiments read like a culinary thriller:

We tried using microwave oven, but it's a little challenging for us to control the heat, as evidenced by the culinary disaster below...

  ![](images/56.jpg)

  What happens when yam meets **uncontrolled microwave energy**?
  The white sugar caramelized upon heating – expanding with vigorous bubbling as pyrolysis occurred, releasing aromatic compounds and developing a rich amber hue through the Maillard reaction.

??? note "(っ'ヮ'c)"
    ~~Wow, mouthwatering caramel!~~

  The yam and sugar are tightly bonded together, forming a hard...hmm...**statue** 🗿? It was so structurally sound that when we tried placing the plate upside down, the dish remain still and **DIDN'T FALL**...Σ(°ロ°)

  Luckily, we managed to find substitutional methods for steaming like boiling, and thus successfully finished the thrilling cooking. See⁭[ →Night Before the Event](#night-before-the-event)

???+ tip "( ≧ᗜ≦)" 
    The hilarious part? We take the kitchen catastrophe on the event, and multiple people actually eyed that culinary trainwreck with interest and asked for a taste(˶°ㅁ°)!!

  Speaking of which, the statue's legacy lives on! Presently the **statue** is still kept as a memorial by our chef. It **REMAINS INTACT** so far as months have passed...
