# Jiangnan Flavour

![](images/1.jpg)



## Inspiration

We discovered these problems faced by international students when adapting to Chinese food:

- Unfamiliar with Chinese texture vocabulary
- Unfamiliar with Chinese culinary cooking techniques

Therefore, on Dec 20th, 2025, we take an active part in the New Year Gala organized by ISU.

    ‚Ä¢ **Quintessential Chinese Ingredients**
    
    - Chinese yam: A staple in Traditional Chinese Medicine cuisine
    - Osmanthus sugar: A Hangzhou heritage ingredient dating to Southern Song Dynasty
    - Rose petal jam: Yunnan's floral terroir expression
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Western Accents**
    
    - Condensed milk & cream: Spellbinding culinary integration
    - Chinese motifs mingled with European techniques(Cake piping originally decided)
    - Mint garnish: Modern gastronomic plating aesthetics

    **‚Ä¢ Southern Song Dynasty Revival**
    
    - *Nan Song Hu Ji* pastries resurrect 12th-century imperial recipes, like edible time capsules from Hangzhou‚Äôs golden age. Their "West Lake Snow Cake" mirrors the poetic scenery that inspired Song dynasty painters.
    
    **‚Ä¢ Osmanthus‚Äô Cultural Code**
    The osmanthus in our desserts isn‚Äôt just flavor ‚Äì it‚Äôs a **living symbol**. In China:
    
    - Blooms during the Mid-Autumn Festival (family reunion season)
    - Ancient scholars wrote poems about its apricot-like fragrance
    - Used in **wedding desserts** as a prosperity charm
    
    **‚Ä¢ Medicinal Wisdom Meets Modern Palates**
    Chinese yam (*shƒÅny√†o*):
    
    - Called "the people‚Äôs ginseng" in Traditional Chinese Medicine for digestive benefits
    - Its sticky texture represents **longevity** in food symbolism
    - Possessing great cross-cultural appeal along with sugary osmanthus,blueberry & rosepetal sauces

    ‚Ä¢ **Traditional Chinese Culinary Techniques**

    Unlike Western cooking's predominant roasting, lots of traditional Chinese dishes employ steaming to preserve *qi* (vital energy) ‚Äì a Confucian "harmony" principle
    
    ???+ note
    
        Actually we used boiling as a substitution of steaming. For the reason, come to [**Kitchenantics**](Event Snapshots.md#kitchenantics).
    
    ‚Ä¢ **Integrated Western Culinary Techniques**
    
    - **Condensed Milk Application**
      *French p√¢tisserie technique* adapted for:
        - Balancing yam‚Äôs earthy notes with sugary sweetness
        - Creating smoother texture than traditional Chinese granulated sugar coatings
    - **Light Cream Emulsification**
        Borrowed from *Italian mascarpone preparation*:
        - Stabilizes yam‚Äôs mucilage (prevents stringiness)
        - Enables piping consistency without gelatin (uncommon in classic Chinese desserts)
    
    - **Cake Piping Methods(Originally planned)**
        - Integrating Chinese flavors with French pastry techniques
    - **Mint Garnish Logic**
      *Modern gastronomy color theory*:
        - Green contrasts white-yam for visual "pop"
        - Freshens palate between bites (Western tasting menu approach)
    
    - **Temperature Control**
      Precision simmering:
        - More accurate than traditional "wu huo" (Ê≠¶ÁÅ´) flame adjustment
        - Preserves osmanthus‚Äô volatile aromatics

    Try peeling the yam (Sounds easy but quite slippery on hand)!
    

    ???+ warning
        Wearing gloves is a must, for the sticky slime on peeled yams will cause an allergic reaction.
        
    
        It really iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitches!!!

## Our Recipe(,,>„ÉÆ<,,)

### Creamy Yam
<div class="grid cards force-vertical" markdown>

-   Creamy Yam **MADE BY OURSELVES!**
    

    ---

    ![](images/9.jpg){ .float-left }

    ???+ note
        Merged with sugar and milk, the unique aroma yam offers you an unparalled silky favor mingled with sweetness.
    
      

</div>

#### Ingredients

- 1 kg mealy yam (preferably iron-stick yam)
- 1 tbsp white vinegar (for soaking)
- **Coating**: Generous amount of white sugar
- 60g condensed milk
- 65g light cream

???+ caution
    Note that excessive light cream will make the yam too thin to shape 

#### Steps

1. **Prep the Yam**

    * Wear gloves

    ???+ warning
        Sticky slime on peeled yams will cause an allergic reaction.
        
        It really iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitches!!!

    * Peel and soak in vinegar water (1 tbsp white vinegar + water) for 10 mins to **prevent oxidation** (browning).

     ![](images/23.jpg)

2. **Clean & Cut**

    - Scrub yam segments in vinegar water until **smooth and white** (removes allergens).
    - Cut into chunks, place on a heatproof plate, and **liberally coat with sugar**.

3. **Steam**

    - Steam for 30 mins over high heat. Sugar will melt into syrup.

4. **Blend** (*Critical texture steps*)

    - Transfer yam + syrup to a blender. Add condensed milk and cream.
    - **Blend for 10-20 secs max** (*over-blending makes paste too thin*).
    - **No water added** ‚Äì relies on natural moisture offered by the syrup.

    ???+ Alternatives tip
        - Hand-mashing: For grainier texture (traditional approach).
        - No dairy: Lighter, herbal flavor but less aromatic.

5. **Pipe & Serve**

    - Sieve paste if lumpy (*prevents clogging piping tip*).

    - Shape the paste onto plates.

    ???+ question "Pity"
        We initially planned to make delicate decorations with a piping bag, but it's a pity that such a step isn't implemented due to time constraints (‚óû‚Ä∏ ‚óü)üíß

    - Garnish with mint leaves

    - Top with the **sauce** and enjoy‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø(Àµ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ·¥ó - Àµ ) ‚úß.







### Osmanthus Sugar
<div class="grid cards force-vertical" markdown>

-   Osmanthus Sugar **MADE BY OURSELVES!**
    

    ---

    ![](images/5.jpg){ .float-left }

    ???+ note
        Consisting of water, sugar and osmanthus flowers, Osmanthus Sugar clearly distinguishes from Osmanthus Honey Blends
    
      

</div>


#### Ingredients & Tools

- 300g white granulated sugar
- 150g water *(measured precisely)*
- 20g dried osmanthus flowers *(tea-grade preferred)*
- 30g lemon juice *(‚âà¬Ω lemon, strained)*
- 1g salt *(**anti-crystallization** agent)*
- Heavy-bottomed saucepan *(essential for even heating)*



#### Steps

1. **Flower Prep**

    - Rinse (if using fresh) ‚Üí Sun-dry until crisp
    - *or* Use pre-dried tea-grade osmanthus *(no washing needed)*

2. **Sugar Syrup Base**

    - Combine sugar + water ‚Üí **High heat** until boiling
    - Reduce to **low simmer** (6 mins)
    - üî• **Critical**: Water ratio must be exact!
    ???+ tip
        Better under- than over-hydrated ‚Äì easily adjusted later

3. **Floral Infusion**

    - Add osmanthus + lemon juice + salt ‚Üí **Return to boil**

     ![](images/20.jpg)

    ???+ Mishap
        Actually from the photo you can find that due to time constraints, our chef inadvertently reversed the sequence, adding osmanthus flowers immediately after sugar - yet serendipitously, the dish retained its aromatic integrity.( ‚∏ù‚∏ù¬¥Íí≥`‚∏ù‚∏ù)

    - Simmer 4 mins *(set timer!)*

    - üçã Pro Tip: Strain lemon seeds to avoid bitterness





## Kitchenantics

On our trial (weeks before the event) we used a steamer, which created ideal Creamy Yam smoothly. 



BUT, on the real run we find the kitchen **WITHOUT A SUITABLE STEAMER**!!!( Í©ú ·ØÖ Í©ú;)‚Å≠ ‚Å≠




We tried using microwave oven, but it's a little challenging for us to control the heat, as evidenced by the culinary disaster below...

  ![](images/56.jpg)

  The white sugar caramelized upon heating ‚Äì expanding with vigorous bubbling as pyrolysis occurred, releasing aromatic compounds and developing a rich amber hue through the Maillard reaction.

??? note
    ~~Wow, mouthwatering caramel!~~

  The yam and sugar are tightly bonded together, forming a hard...hmm...statue? We tried placing the plate upside down, and the dish remain still and didn't fall...

  Luckily, we managed to find substitutional methods for steaming like boiling, and thus successfully finished the thrilling cooking.

???+ LoL tip
    The hilarious part? We take the kitchen catastrophe on the event, and multiple people actually eyed that culinary trainwreck with interest and asked for a taste(À∂¬∞„ÖÅ¬∞)!!

  Speaking of which, presently the statue is still kept as a memorial by one of our group member. It remains intact so far as months have passed...
